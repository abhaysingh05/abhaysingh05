**NK Securities Research Hackathon 2025**  
*Python • Data Imputation • Volatility Modeling*  
- Ranked 16th out of 2,095 entrants in a national options forecasting challenge hosted by NK Securities  
- Processed high-frequency NIFTY50 options data and engineered an imputation matrix across 52 IV columns  
- Tuned ExtraTrees-based IterativeImputer, outperforming XGBoost, interpolation, and PCA-ridge baselines
- Visualized volatility smiles with matplotlib and validated results with automated MSE checks (final MSE: 0.000001132)
