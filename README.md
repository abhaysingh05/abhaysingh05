I am Abhay Singh, currently pursuing a B.Tech. in Chemical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur (IITKGP). I’m passionate about competitive programming and machine learning, and I’m consistently working to deepen my skills in both.
Beyond that, I have a strong interest in core computer science subjects such as Operating Systems, Data Structures and Algorithms, Computer Networks, and probability-based problem solving.
I’m actively seeking opportunities in Software Development and Quantitative Research roles. Feel free to connect or reach out if you'd like to collaborate or request my resume.
My GitHub repositories demonstrate hands-on implementations in Python and C++, covering end-to-end solutions from data simulation to user interfaces and file compression algorithms.
